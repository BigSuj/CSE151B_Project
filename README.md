# CSE151B_Project


GitHub Repository contains all the different types of neural networks and models we worked with throughout this project. 

Files to test for inference:
 - MLP_model contains both MLP model and Linear Regression model
     - downloading data is already coded
     - running notebook should do training and create model

 - RNN_and_FNN model contains an RNN model and Feedforard Neural Network model
     - again, downloading data is already in code. 
     - running notebook should train and create model


If data already exists within the repository you are working in, DO NOT run the downloading data cell. 
It will ask you if you want to replace the files but jupyter notebooks do not allow that type of interaction with the terminal. 
So just skip that cell.
